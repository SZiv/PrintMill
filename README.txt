PrintMill

This is printMill, a quick little project to develop a machine that could be laser cut and 3D printed while stable enough to hold a Harbor Freight Router and cut aluminum.  

All in all, the repo is a bit messy, and all I have are 2016 Autodesk Inventor Ipt files, but dispite a little bit of wobbling, the device does function. 

Other than a bunch of 3D printer filament and a few acrylic panels, you will need a bunch of 8mm Rod, LM8UUs, LM8LUUs, a RAMPS board with all the fixins', as well as 3 leadscrews and nuts. And a harbor Freight dremel.
